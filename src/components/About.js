        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi thereðŸ‘‹<br />I'm a final-year Computer Science student at JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping University, specializing in Software Development and Mobile Platforms. I'm passionate about coding and problem-solving. I did an internship at Sweco as a software developer and unit tester, where I gained practical experience. Right now, I'm working on my bachelor's thesis using AI to count people in a room with a video camera. I enjoy learning new technologies and solving problems.I am familiar to use C++, Java, Python, Swift, and JavaScript. I also use tools like Git and SQL.I'm always eager to learn new technologies and apply my skills to solve real-world problems. I'm looking for a job to gain more experience and continue growing in the tech field.
