        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi thereðŸ‘‹<br />Fast learner who's passionate about coding, problem-solving,
            and creating tech solutions. Currently building skills in web and mobile development,
            I'm always excited to learn and take on new challenges
          I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Development and Mobile Platforms at JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping University. 
          I have developed strong skills in programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, and React. My experience includes 
          several projects in web and mobile development, along with an internship at Sweco, where I worked as a software developer and unit tester. 
          There, I developed a Proof of Concept (POC) app and conducted unit tests, enhancing my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities.
